# login-and-logout-time
JavaScript project of of handling promise



I want you to create one function called updateLastUserActivityTime which returns a promise.
Every time the user creates a post, the user's lastActivity time should get called (should execute in 1 second)
.When both the promises resolve (createPost and updateLastUserActivityTime ),
I want you to console log all the posts created and lastActivityTime of the user. [If stuck for long watch the hint 2]
Once both the above promises are resolved , I want you to delete the last post by calling the deletion promise. Once successfully deleted, I want you to log the new set of Posts of the user.
